## 2019 HTTP/2 Flood Vulnerabilities (Netflix Discovery)

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Jonathan Looney of Netflix and disclosed in August 2019:

- **CVE-2019-9511 - Data Dribble**
  - Sending small DATA frames to keep streams open and consume resources
  
- **CVE-2019-9512 - Ping Flood**
  - Sending continuous PING frames to cause resource exhaustion
  
- **CVE-2019-9513 - Resource Loop**
  - Creating request loops between streams to amplify resource consumption
  
- **CVE-2019-9514 - Reset Flood**
  - Sending RST_STREAM frames to force expensive operations
  
- **CVE-2019-9515 - Settings Flood**
  - Sending multiple SETTINGS frames to force state changes
  
- **CVE-2019-9516 - 0-Length Headers Leak**
  - Sending headers with 0-length to trigger memory leaks
  
- **CVE-2019-9517 - Internal Data Buffering**
  - Window update manipulation causing integer overflow
  
- **CVE-2019-9518 - Empty Frames Flood**
  - Sending floods of empty DATA/HEADERS frames

## 2016 HPACK Vulnerability

- **CVE-2016-4462 - HPACK Bomb**
  - Sending highly compressed headers that expand massively when decoded
  - Can cause memory exhaustion through compression ratio attacks

## 2023-2024 Major Vulnerabilities

### Rapid Reset Family
- **CVE-2023-44487 - HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack**
  - The most severe HTTP/2 vulnerability to date
  - Exploited in attacks reaching 398 million requests per second
  - Affects all HTTP/2 implementations
  
- **CVE-2023-35945**
  - Additional HTTP/2 DoS vulnerability related to Rapid Reset
  
- **CVE-2023-43622**
  - Apache-specific vulnerability discovered during Rapid Reset testing
  
- **CVE-2023-45288**
  - Go HTTP/2 implementation vulnerability

## 2024 CONTINUATION Flood Family

A new class of vulnerabilities potentially more severe than Rapid Reset:

- **CVE-2024-27316** - Apache HTTP Server CONTINUATION flood
- **CVE-2024-24549** - Apache Tomcat CONTINUATION flood
- **CVE-2024-31309** - Apache Traffic Server CONTINUATION flood
- **CVE-2024-27919** - nghttp2 CONTINUATION vulnerability
- **CVE-2024-30255** - Envoy proxy CONTINUATION vulnerability
- **CVE-2024-2653** - amphp/http CONTINUATION vulnerability
- **CVE-2024-2758** - Additional CONTINUATION flood variant
- **CVE-2024-27983** - Node.js HTTP/2 vulnerability
- **CVE-2024-28182** - nghttp2 CONTINUATION vulnerability

## Apache-Specific HTTP/2 Vulnerabilities

- **CVE-2024-40725** - Apache HTTP Server vulnerability (versions 2.4.0-2.4.61)
- **CVE-2024-40898** - Apache HTTP Server vulnerability (versions 2.4.0-2.4.61)
- **CVE-2024-39573** - SSRF vulnerability in Apache on Windows with mod_rewrite
- **CVE-2024-39884** - Handler configuration vulnerability
- **CVE-2024-38475** - Pre-authentication arbitrary file read

## Key Attack Categories

### 1. Flood Attacks
- Overwhelming servers with specific frame types (PING, SETTINGS, RST_STREAM, PRIORITY)
- Exploiting lack of rate limiting in implementations

### 2. Resource Exhaustion
- Keeping connections/streams open to consume memory
- Creating states that require excessive server resources

### 3. Compression Attacks
- Exploiting HPACK to cause memory exhaustion
- Compression ratio attacks (HPACK bomb)

### 4. Protocol Abuse
- Using legitimate protocol features maliciously
- Exploiting protocol complexity for DoS

### 5. Integer Overflows
- Manipulating window sizes and other numeric values
- Causing arithmetic overflows in flow control

### 6. State Confusion
- Forcing expensive state changes through frame sequences
- Exploiting state machine weaknesses

## Severity Notes

### Critical Severity
- **CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset)** is considered the most severe, enabling record-breaking DDoS attacks
- **2024 CONTINUATION flood** vulnerabilities are potentially more severe than Rapid Reset

### Important Considerations
- Many vulnerabilities affect the core HTTP/2 protocol, meaning all implementations are potentially vulnerable
- Patches must be applied at the implementation level
- Rate limiting and resource bounds are critical for protection

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Apply patches immediately** when available from vendors
2. **Implement rate limiting** for all frame types
3. **Set resource bounds** for connections, streams, and memory usage
4. **Monitor for unusual traffic patterns** indicating exploitation
5. **Use DDoS protection services** for internet-facing services
6. **Keep HTTP/2 implementations up to date**
