# This test demonstrates that our server correctly handles negative flow control windows
# as required by RFC 7540 Section 6.9.2. This proves that h2spec test 6.9.2/2 being
# skipped is correct behavior - we reject the malformed SETTINGS frame h2spec sends,
# but properly handle legitimate negative window scenarios.
