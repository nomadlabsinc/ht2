# TODO.md

This document tracks remaining tasks for the HT2 HTTP/2 server implementation.

## üîß RFC Compliance Issues

### Stream State Management
- [x] Consider refactoring to a more formal state machine pattern


## üõ°Ô∏è Security Issues

### Rapid Reset Attack (CVE-2023-44487)
- [x] Implement pending stream queue with configurable limits
- [x] Add per-IP rate limiting for stream creation
- [x] Track and limit rapid stream creation/cancellation patterns
- [x] Add metrics for monitoring rapid reset patterns

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Direct HTTP/2 Prior Knowledge Support (RFC 7540 Section 3.4)
- [x] Implement connection type detection without consuming data
  - [x] Create BufferedSocket wrapper that allows peeking at initial bytes
  - [x] Implement peek(n) method that doesn't consume bytes from socket
  - [x] Handle both IO::Buffered and raw socket types
  - [x] Ensure thread-safe operation for concurrent connections
- [x] Detect HTTP/2 connection preface (PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n)
  - [x] Check first 24 bytes for exact match
  - [x] Distinguish from HTTP/1.1 methods (GET, POST, etc.)
  - [x] Handle partial reads gracefully
- [x] Create routing logic in Server#handle_h2c_client
  - [x] Peek at first bytes to detect connection type
  - [x] Route to handle_h2c_prior_knowledge for HTTP/2 preface
  - [x] Route to handle_h2c_upgrade for HTTP/1.1 requests
  - [x] Handle edge cases (empty reads, timeouts, errors)
- [x] Implement handle_h2c_prior_knowledge method
  - [x] Skip HTTP/1.1 upgrade negotiation entirely
  - [x] Create Connection with buffered socket containing preface
  - [x] Let Connection.start() consume the preface normally
  - [x] Apply default settings for the connection
- [x] Update Connection to work with buffered input
  - [x] Ensure read operations work with BufferedSocket
  - [x] Handle transition from buffered to direct socket reads
  - [x] Maintain performance for non-buffered connections
- [x] Add prior knowledge client support
  - [x] Add use_prior_knowledge option to Client
  - [x] Skip upgrade negotiation when enabled
  - [x] Send preface immediately after connecting
  - [x] Cache prior knowledge support per host
- [x] Create comprehensive tests
  - [x] Test BufferedSocket peek functionality
  - [x] Test connection type detection logic
  - [x] Test prior knowledge server handling
  - [x] Test prior knowledge client connections
  - [x] Test mixed connection types (upgrade and prior knowledge)
  - [x] Performance tests to ensure no regression
- [x] Update examples and documentation
  - [x] Add prior knowledge example server
  - [x] Add prior knowledge example client
  - [x] Document when to use prior knowledge vs upgrade
  - [x] Add curl examples with --http2-prior-knowledge


## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Connection Management
- [x] Implement connection pooling for client connections
- [x] Add connection warm-up (pre-established connections)
- [x] Implement graceful connection draining

### Stream Processing
- [x] Implement bounded worker pool for stream handling
- [x] Add backpressure mechanisms for slow consumers
- [x] Optimize memory allocation for frame processing

### I/O Optimizations
- [x] Implement zero-copy frame forwarding where possible
- [x] Add vectored I/O for multi-frame writes
- [x] Optimize buffer sizes based on connection patterns

## üîç Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- [x] Add connection-level metrics (streams, data transferred, errors)
- [x] Add frame-type specific counters
- [x] Implement performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- [x] Add security event metrics

### Debugging Support
- [x] Add debug mode with frame logging
- [x] Implement connection state dumping
- [x] Add stream lifecycle tracing
