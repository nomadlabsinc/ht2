## ðŸ”§ Remaining Issues (8 failing tests)

The remaining 8 failing tests are all in the "Generic tests" category and appear to be related to a flow control or stream lifecycle issue where the server is not properly responding to certain frame types in specific test scenarios.

### TODO: Fix Generic Frame Tests
1. **Stream lifecycle tests** (3 tests)
   - WINDOW_UPDATE frame on half-closed (remote) stream
   - PRIORITY frame on half-closed (remote) stream  
   - PRIORITY frame on closed stream

2. **Generic frame processing tests** (13 tests)
   - DATA frame tests (3 tests)
   - HEADERS frame tests (3 tests)
   - PRIORITY frame tests (5 tests)
   - WINDOW_UPDATE frame tests (1 test)
   - CONTINUATION frame tests (2 tests)

3. **HTTP message tests** (3 tests)
   - GET request test
   - HEAD request test
   - POST request test

### Root Cause Analysis
The failing tests appear to be timing out or receiving SETTINGS ACK frames instead of the expected responses. This suggests an issue with:
- Stream state management for half-closed streams
- Generic frame processing in test scenarios
- Flow control window handling when window size is set to 1

### Next Steps
1. Debug the stream lifecycle for half-closed streams
2. Investigate why generic frame tests are timing out
3. Fix flow control handling for very small window sizes
4. Ensure proper response generation for test scenarios
