## ðŸ”§ Test Configuration

### Test 5.1.1.2: Stream identifier validation failure
- **Status**: Failing (1 of 146 tests)
- **Issue**: Server responds with DATA frame instead of GOAWAY with PROTOCOL_ERROR when receiving stream ID numerically smaller than previous
- **Expected**: GOAWAY Frame (Error Code: PROTOCOL_ERROR) + Connection closed
- **Actual**: DATA Frame (length:185, flags:0x01, stream_id:5)
- **Impact**: Minor protocol violation in stream ID ordering validation

## âœ… Protocol Compliance Summary

The HT2 server achieves **99.3% compliance** with the HTTP/2 specification:
- 145 h2spec tests pass in both CI and local environments
- 1 test fails (5.1.1.2 - stream identifier ordering validation)
- Total: 145 of 146 HTTP/2 protocol requirements satisfied

This represents near-complete HTTP/2 protocol compliance suitable for most production use cases.
